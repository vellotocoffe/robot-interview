A simple spring-boot application for "robot interview".
# About SOLID principles and Clean code
In this simple application, i am aware about SOLID and Clean code by implementing below list :

- Each interface has an single goal and cross-concerns are externalized by using spring AOP. (**single responsibility**)
- Applying **template** design pattern pattern for a better **open-close** principle.
- Classes implement only the features they need (**Interface Segregation Principle**).
- Dependencies injection for inversion of control by using Spring DI container (**Inversion of control**).
- Avoid hard-coded code by using costumed enums and external configuration.
- Keep method signature simple and clear.
